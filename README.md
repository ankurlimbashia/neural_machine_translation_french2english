# neural_machine_translation_french2english

In machine translation, the input already consists of a series of symbols in some language, and the computer program must convert this into a series of symbols in a different language.

Neural machine translation (NMT) is a proposition to machine translation that uses an artificial neural network to predict the probability of a sequence of words, typically modeling whole sentences in a single integrated model.

Here, we will create a LSTM autoencoder model with RepeatVector and TimeDistributed layers, which will translate French sentences into their English entences using Keras and python.
